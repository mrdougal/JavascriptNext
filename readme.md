#Javascript ES6 textmate2 bundle

A collection of snippets handy for use with ES6 and TextMate2
I would recommend [this guide](http://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es6/) on learning ES6.
**Please note** that your ES6 code needs to be transpiled to ES5 before it will run in the browser.


##Installation instructions

`git clone git@github.com:mrdougal/JavascriptNext.git ~/Desktop/JavascriptNext.tmbundle`

Then double click to open, TextMate will prompt you if you want to install this bundle


> This is a work in progress, as i start using ES6 more with TextMate
